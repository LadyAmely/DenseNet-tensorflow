# DenseNet Implementation in TensorFlow
---

This repository contains an implementation of the DenseNet architecture in TensorFlow. DenseNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture known for its efficiency in parameter usage and performance in image classification tasks.

## Dataset

In this project, VGGNet was trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, showcasing its effectiveness even on simpler datasets for classification tasks.
